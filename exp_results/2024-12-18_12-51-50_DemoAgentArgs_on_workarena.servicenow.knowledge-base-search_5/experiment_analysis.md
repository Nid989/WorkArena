### Next Action

The current page is the Knowledge Home on the ServiceNow platform, which is likely a portal for accessing various knowledge articles and information. To find the exact amount of water utilized by office #456 each year, I need to search for relevant information within this knowledge base. The page has a search functionality that I can use to look for specific articles or data.

I will use the search feature to look for information related to the water usage of office #456. This will involve filling the search input with a relevant query and executing the search.

Let's proceed with filling the search input with the query "water usage office #456" and then executing the search.

```fill('112', 'water usage office #456')```
```
